Our prototype is coming along nicely, but there are are some critical things we still need to add:

* First, instead of pressing S to spawn animals, we will spawn them on a timer so that they appear automatically.
* Next, we will add colliders to our prefabs and add a script so that launching a projectile into an animal will destroy it.
* Finally, we will display a “Game Over” message on the console if any of the animals make it past the player.
